=== Documentation style guidelines

When updating lutaml-xsd documentation, follow these principles:

**Heading style**::
* Use sentence-case for all headings (e.g., "Schema mappings", not "Schema
Mappings")
* Use descriptive, clear headings that indicate content scope

**Structure**::
* Begin with a Purpose section explaining what the document covers
* Include a General section for background and key concepts
* Organize content into logical sections with clear hierarchy
* Use "See also" section at the end for cross-references

**MECE principle**::
* **Mutually Exclusive**: Each document covers a distinct topic without
overlap
* **Collectively Exhaustive**: All topics covered without gaps
* Avoid duplicate information across documents

**Examples and code**::
* Wrap examples with `[example]` and `====` delimiters
* Use `[source,lang]` with `----` delimiters for code blocks
* Provide clear example titles describing what is shown
* Include explanation after code examples
* Use practical, real-world examples when possible

**Lists**::
* Separate lists from surrounding content with blank lines before and after
* Ordered lists: Use `. ` flush with the line beginning
* Unordered lists: Use `* ` flush with the line beginning
* Second-level ordered: Use `.. `
* Second-level unordered: Use `** `
* Definition lists: Use `term:: description` format

**Line length and formatting**::
* Wrap lines at 80 characters
* Exceptions: Cross-references, formulas, and code blocks
* No "hanging paragraphs" - if needed, create a "General" subsection

**Cross-references**::
* Link to related documents using `link:DOCUMENT[Link text]`
* Include "See also" section listing related documentation
* Reference specific sections using anchors where appropriate

**File organization**::
* Each file uses `:toc:` and `:toclevels: 3` for navigation
* Keep files focused on a single topic
* Aim for 200-500 lines per document (except comprehensive references)

=== Content guidelines

**Clarity**::
* Write in clear, technical prose
* Define terms when first introduced
* Use consistent terminology throughout

**Completeness**::
* Provide complete syntax definitions
* Include "Where," legend explaining syntax elements
* Show both basic and advanced usage

**Accuracy**::
* Verify all code examples work correctly
* Ensure cross-references point to existing documents
* Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

**Accessibility**::
* Write for users with varying expertise levels
* Progress from simple to complex topics
* Link to prerequisite knowledge
