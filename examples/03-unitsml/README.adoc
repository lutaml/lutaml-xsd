= UnitsML Example

== Purpose

This example demonstrates working with scientific and technical standards focused on specialized domain vocabulary.

Learn how to:

* Build LXR packages from scientific standards
* Work with measurement and unit definitions
* Handle domain-specific type hierarchies
* Explore specialized vocabularies

UnitsML is an OASIS standard for representing units of measure in a machine-readable format, used in scientific computing, engineering, and metrology.

== What This Example Demonstrates

=== Scientific Standards

The UnitsML schema provides:

* Standard unit definitions (meter, kilogram, second, etc.)
* Derived units (velocity, acceleration, force, etc.)
* Unit conversions and relationships
* Dimensional analysis support
* Prefix handling (kilo, mega, milli, etc.)

=== Domain-Specific Type Structures

Unit-related types include:

* Unit definitions (base and derived)
* Quantity types (physical quantities)
* Dimension specifications
* Prefix definitions
* Symbol representations

=== Specialized Vocabulary

Scientific terminology modeled:

* SI Base Units (International System)
* Physical dimensions
* Measurement systems
* Unit symbols and names

=== Clean Schema Structure

Unlike complex standards with many imports, UnitsML demonstrates:

* Single-file schema organization
* Clear type hierarchy
* Well-defined namespaces
* Focused domain model

== Configuration

The [`config.yml`](config.yml) file is simple:

[source,yaml]
----
files:
  - ../../spec/fixtures/unitsml-v1.0-csd04.xsd

namespace_mappings:
  - prefix: "units"
    uri: "urn:oasis:names:tc:unitsml:schema:xsd:UnitsMLSchema-1.0"
----

Where:

`files`:: Single UnitsML schema file
`namespace_mappings`:: UnitsML namespace with standard URN

== Running the Examples

=== Ruby API Example

[source,bash]
----
ruby examples/03-unitsml/ruby-api/example.rb
----

Features demonstrated:

. Building packages from scientific standards
. Type categorization (complex vs simple types)
. Domain-specific type discovery
. Namespace analysis

=== CLI Example

[source,bash]
----
bash examples/03-unitsml/cli/run.sh
----

CLI commands demonstrated:

. Standard package building
. Type searching in scientific vocabulary
. Package metadata inspection
. Type listing and categorization

== Expected Output

Creates `unitsml.lxr` containing:

* Schemas: 1 (self-contained standard)
* Types: 30-50 (unit-related definitions)
* Namespaces: 1-2 (UnitsML + XML Schema)

Fast build time due to single-file structure.

== Key Concepts

=== Scientific Data Modeling

UnitsML demonstrates:

* Precise definition of scientific concepts
* Machine-readable unit specifications
* Conversion factor representations
* Dimensional consistency

=== Standard Vocabularies

Benefits of standardized vocabulary:

* Interoperability between systems
* Unambiguous unit specifications
* Automated unit conversions
* Validation of dimensional consistency

=== Domain-Focused Schemas

Characteristics of good domain schemas:

* Clear scope and purpose
* Well-defined terminology
* Minimal external dependencies
* Comprehensive coverage of domain

== Use Cases

=== Scientific Computing

UnitsML supports:

* Automated unit conversion
* Dimensional analysis
* Physical quantity validation
* Scientific data exchange

=== Engineering Applications

Applications include:

* CAD/CAM systems
* Simulation software
* Measurement databases
* Quality control systems

=== Metrology

Measurement science applications:

* Calibration data
* Uncertainty quantification
* Traceability chains
* Standards compliance

== Type Examples

Common UnitsML types you'll find:

* `UnitType` - Definition of a measurement unit
* `QuantityType` - Physical quantity (length, mass, time, etc.)
* `DimensionSetType` - Dimensional specifications
* `PrefixType` - Unit prefixes (kilo-, mega-, etc.)
* `RootUnitsType` - Base unit combinations

== Exploring Types

Search for unit-related concepts:

[source,bash]
----
# Search for unit definitions
lutaml-xsd search Unit unitsml.lxr

# Search for quantities
lutaml-xsd search Quantity unitsml.lxr

# Search for dimensions
lutaml-xsd search Dimension unitsml.lxr
----

== Next Steps

After mastering scientific schemas:

. Try link:../04-metaschema/README.adoc[04-metaschema] for self-referential schemas
. Review link:../02-urban-function/README.adoc[02-urban-function] for complex imports
. Apply concepts to your own domain-specific schemas
