# Schema Filtering Example
#
# This example demonstrates how to include or exclude specific schemas
# from packages using glob patterns.

base_packages:
  # Include all schemas from first package
  - package: ../01-simple/simple.lxr
    priority: 0
    conflict_resolution: keep
    # No filtering - include all schemas

  # Include only specific schemas from second package
  - package: ../03-unitsml/unitsml.lxr
    priority: 10
    conflict_resolution: override
    
    # Option 1: Exclude specific schemas
    exclude_schemas:
      # Exclude test files
      - "**/test_*.xsd"
      - "**/*_test.xsd"
      
      # Exclude deprecated schemas
      - "**/deprecated_*.xsd"
      - "legacy/**"
      
      # Exclude specific directories
      - "examples/**"
      - "internal/**"
    
    # Option 2: Include only specific schemas (commented out)
    # When include_only_schemas is set, ONLY matching schemas are included
    # include_only_schemas:
    #   - "**/core/*.xsd"
    #   - "**/essential/*.xsd"
    #   - "schemas/main.xsd"

# Glob pattern syntax:
# - * matches any characters within a path component
# - ** matches across directory boundaries  
# - ? matches a single character
# - [abc] matches any character in the set
# - {a,b} matches either pattern a or b
#
# Filter precedence:
# 1. If exclude_schemas matches → exclude
# 2. If include_only_schemas is set and doesn't match → exclude
# 3. Otherwise → include
#
# Common filtering patterns:
#
# Exclude test files:
#   - "**/test_*.xsd"
#   - "**/*_test.xsd"  
#   - "tests/**"
#
# Exclude deprecated/legacy:
#   - "**/deprecated_*.xsd"
#   - "**/*.old.xsd"
#   - "legacy/**"
#
# Exclude by directory:
#   - "internal/**"
#   - "examples/**"
#   - "drafts/**"
#
# Include only production schemas:
#   include_only_schemas:
#     - "production/**"
#     - "release/**"
#     - "**/v[0-9]*/*.xsd"  # Version directories
#
# Include only specific namespaces:
#   include_only_schemas:
#     - "schemas/gml/**"
#     - "schemas/iso/**"
#     - "schemas/core/**"
